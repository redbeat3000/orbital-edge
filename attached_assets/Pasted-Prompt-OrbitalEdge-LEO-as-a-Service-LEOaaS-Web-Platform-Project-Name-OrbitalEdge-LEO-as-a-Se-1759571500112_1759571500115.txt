Prompt: OrbitalEdge— LEO-as-a-Service (LEOaaS) Web Platform

Project Name: OrbitalEdge — LEO-as-a-Service (LEOaaS)
Tagline: Launch less. Do more in orbit.

Project Definition:
OrbitalHub is a web-based platform that provides modular, on-demand access to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) resources for research labs, startups, and universities. It functions as a marketplace for rentable orbital payload slots and on-orbit microservices such as computing, data storage, thermal cycling, and sample return. The platform allows small teams to run experiments, deploy microservices, or test hardware in LEO without launching a full satellite, reducing cost and complexity while increasing accessibility to space.

Core Features:

Marketplace: Providers (rideshare launches, satellite hosts, CubeSat integrators) list available payload slots and on-orbit services. Customers browse and book slots for experiments or services.

Scheduling & Simulation: Shows orbital windows, cost estimates, and mission timelines. Users can simulate their payload’s orbit and service duration.

Experiment & Data Management: Upload experiment code or data, monitor telemetry and execution results, request sample-return capsules if needed.

Technical Integration: Standardized modular payload adapter, API for scheduling, uploading, monitoring, and requesting returns.

Business Management: Handles manifests, insurance, regulatory compliance, and rideshare matchmaking.

Target Users:

University research labs (microgravity experiments, material science, biotech)

Startups testing edge-AI, Earth-observation sensors, or in-space computing

CubeSat integrators needing short-term hosting

Key Benefits:

Reduces cost and lead time compared to launching full satellites

Standardized modular interface simplifies integration

Provides scalable, pay-per-use access to space resources

Encourages commercial R&D in LEO responsibly and safely

Design & UX Requirements:

Homepage: Animated 3D Earth orbit with rotating satellites and active payloads. Minimal text, large headings, parallax scrolling, smooth transitions, particle effects for realism.

Marketplace Page: 3D interactive marketplace showing payload slots in orbit. Users can filter by service type, duration, provider, and price. Real-time availability updates via API. Clickable, rotatable, zoomable 3D payloads.

Simulation Page: Interactive orbital simulator showing trajectory animations, orbital windows, and cost estimates. Users adjust parameters and see real-time visual feedback.

Experiment Management Dashboard: Modern dashboard UI for uploading experiment code/data, live telemetry charts, and status tracking.

Technical & Hardware Page: Showcase 3D mockups of modular payload adapters, animated connections to satellites and orbit paths.

Futuristic Interactions: Hover effects, micro-animations, smooth transitions, subtle particle effects representing orbital debris and microgravity.

Color Palette & Fonts: Dark mode with neon or metallic accents, sleek sans-serif typography, high contrast, Apple-style minimalism.

Team Roles & Workflow:

Product, frontend, backend, simulation, hardware, business

Workflow: booking → upload → execution → telemetry → return

Innovation / Edge:

Short-duration, modular, pay-per-use

API-driven automation, sample-return service, on-orbit microservices

Marketplace network effects

Prototype Integration:

Marketplace, simulation, and hardware mockup in cohesive demo

Interactive elements: clickable 3D payloads, booking slots, telemetry charts

Goal:
Deliver a fully interactive, API-driven, futuristic 3D website that demonstrates the full LEOaaS experience, feels Apple-inspired, and impresses judges with innovation, interactivity, technical feasibility, commercial viability, and sustainability.

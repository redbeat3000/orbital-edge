# üåç OrbitalEdge ‚Äî LEO-as-a-Service (LEOaaS)

**OrbitalEdge** is a futuristic web-based platform that provides modular, on-demand access to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) resources for **research labs, startups, and universities**.  
It acts as a **marketplace for rentable orbital payload slots and on-orbit microservices** ‚Äî like computing, data storage, thermal cycling, and sample return.

Built to make space research **affordable, accessible, and interactive**, OrbitalEdge combines **3D visualizations**, **real-time simulations**, and **API-driven integrations** to redefine how humanity interacts with orbit.

---

## üöÄ Vision

To democratize access to Low Earth Orbit by creating an open, modular infrastructure where innovators can **book orbital resources**, **run experiments**, and **analyze results** ‚Äî all through a unified digital platform.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Core Features

### 1. **3D Interactive Marketplace**
- Built with **Three.js** and **React**, showcasing Earth and satellite orbits in real time.  
- Users can explore payload slots, visualize orbit paths, and book available positions.

### 2. **Simulation & Scheduling**
- Orbital mechanics engine simulates trajectories, mission durations, and costs.  
- Real-time weather overlays (via **Meteomatics API** and **NASA Space Weather APIs**).

### 3. **Experiment & Data Management**
- Upload code/data for experiments.  
- Monitor telemetry, environmental data, and experiment outcomes.  
- Request **sample return capsules** or data dumps.

### 4. **Business & Compliance**
- Handles manifests, insurance, licensing, and regulatory paperwork.  
- Includes **automated debris management tracking** and sustainability compliance features.

### 5. **Dynamic UI & Design**
- Apple-inspired minimalism:  
  - **Black background**
  - **Glowing orange borders**
  - **White text**
  - **Orange shapes & highlights**  
- Smooth 3D transitions, micro-animations, and holographic-inspired visuals.
